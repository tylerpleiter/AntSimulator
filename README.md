# AntSimulator
A PC simulation game using Unreal Engine and Blender for assets.

Started as a way to gain experience in C++, game design, and 3D modelling and animation. 

At the moment, the basic ant model is complete, along with the custom C++ movement controller and basic animations.

The world will be voxel based, with the preference of using an existing library, to allow for digging and 3D ant nests.

## Major To-Dos
- 3D environment assets
- Models of ant in different life-cycle stages
- Models of several predators and prey
- Custom pathfinding controller capable of navigating walls and ceilings
- Hive AI for controlling worker tasks and behaviour
